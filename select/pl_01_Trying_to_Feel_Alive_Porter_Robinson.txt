Well, do you feel better now?
I thought I'd run
until the sky came out
And with the sunlight on my face
Something changed
And just trying to feel alive
We climbed a mountain,
are you satisfied?
As you stand at the top
You already wanna do this
One more time
Maybe it's the gift
that I couldn't recognize
Maybe I don't really need
to feel satisfied
Maybe it's a gift
that I spend all this time
Just trying to feel alive
Maybe I don't really want
to be satisfied
Maybe it's the gift
that I couldn't recognize
Maybe this is all,
maybe this was all
Then somebody somewhere finds
The warmth of summer
in the songs you write
Maybe it's a gift
that I couldn't recognize
Trying to feel alive

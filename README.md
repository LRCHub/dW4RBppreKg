```lrc
[02:12.87] And do you feel better now?
[02:15.95] I thought I'd run until the sky came out
[02:20.69] And with the sunlight on my face
[02:25.23] Something changed
[02:33.73] 
[02:30.27] And just trying to feel alive
[02:34.06] You climbed a mountain, are you satisfied?
[02:38.35] You stand at the top
[02:40.63] You already wanna do this
[02:44.35] One more time
[02:50.85] 
[02:47.54] Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
[02:51.90] Maybe I don't really need to feel satisfied
[02:56.56] Maybe it's a gift that I spent all this time
[03:01.17] Just trying to feel alive
[03:05.11] Maybe I don't really want to be satisfied
[03:09.78] Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
[03:13.85] Maybe this is all
[03:16.21] Maybe this was all
[03:25.21] 
[04:16.93] Then somebody somewhere finds
[04:20.31] The warmth of summer in the songs you write
[04:25.07] Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
[04:30.49] Trying to feel alive
